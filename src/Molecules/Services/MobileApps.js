      <div className="prod_main_body py-3">Native apps provide us greater usability, superior features and the best overall user experience. At present, native apps provide the best environment for implementing all possible UI touch gestures, enjoy the fastest graphics processing and implement fluid animation (needed in the case of game based apps). We have the expertise to access and make use of various sensors and built-in components of the mobile devices into the app. This is a key advantage that we get with native apps.</div>
      <div className="prod_main_body py-3"><b>How Does It Work?</b> NativeScript enables developers to build native apps for iOS, Android and Windows Universal while sharing the application code across the platforms. When building the application UI, developers use our libraries, which abstract the differences between the native platforms. Watch the video to learn more.</div>

      <div className="prod_main_body py-3">Hybrid mobile apps provide native app experience even though they were built with HTML5 web technologies. We build apps using HTML5 technologies and wrap it inside the native container that opens access to native platform features. We have done this using the Phone Gap framework and have delivered a number of apps to our customers.</div>

      <div className="prod_main_body py-3">HTML5’s USP is Build once and deploy anywhere. It reduces distribution effort, makes support easier and shortens the overall development lifecycle. Availability of open source and proprietary frameworks is also another significant advantage. Our teams have expertise in frameworks like PhoneGap, Kendo UI, Titanium and Angular UI and have created a number of class leading HTML5 mobile applications.</div>
